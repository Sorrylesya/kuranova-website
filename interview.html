      <p>I contacted an interview with Ludmila Anulova â€“ a teacher of extracurricular education for kids. She teaches and art fashion drawing to children at the GBPOU Vorobievi Gory. I, myself, was studying art at this place, so this project was somewhat personal to me. Ludmila's way of talking was not ordinary, she uses expressions a lot, mimics, impersonates people, jokes with herself and makes funny noises while talking. I really wanted to show this extraordinary feature of hers, and point out the different figures of speech she is using. The interview text is set in two columns, where in first you see her words and continuing speech with blank spaces, and in second there are her actions and expressions exactly where the space was blanked in the first column. All my words differ from hers visually and set in the font I made. Also visually there are pictures running across margins all the way from beginning to the end of the interview. The photos were taken during one of Ludmila's lesson I visited.</p>
