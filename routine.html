      <p>My routine project is a recording of the lock in my bedroom door.
The choice of the action was intentional and thought through according to what the term routine actually means. To me, the action of locking my door became automatic and thoughtless, even though the origin of such action was purely emotional.
I decide to play on the contrast of how emotional this is to me and the systematisation of the recording and the process itself. The book shows the actions recorded as symbols and put together in a single layout for the structure-based feel.
The format of the book is proportionate to the size of my bedroom door and the symbols are placed where the lock on the door is.
For the symbols, I’ve chosen: filled circle – locked the door, empty circle – decided not to lock the door, dash – for checking if the door is closed or not.
The use of symbols is a reference to the code systems and check-in papers used at work to exaggerate the conceptual part of the project.
The book has its’ peak in the middle of it where I add a new marker to the system – empty set sign or a crossed circle, which stands for someone unlocking the door by themselves from the outside without my permission. It has the emotional undertone to it, so I change the format and integrate a small comic on a bright yellow paper.
I also included comments on some of the actions and my writing on the topic in the book. They all have the emotional tone to them but put in the soulless grid as a support to the contrary ideas clashed together.
