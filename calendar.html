    <div class="description">
      <p>Two main inspirations and materials for this projects were found in the city graphics. For the text I decided to use the postcard I got in my mailbox a few weeks before the assignment. It was a handmaid postcard with a magazine cutout image of a happy family on the front and orthodox handwritten text on the back. I thought it would be interesting to use the same design decisions (tight margins, hyphenation, all caps, underlying) this person made within this text but make it not handwritten. For the visual part of the design I used the camera road sign. I thought it was an interesting visual element and I enjoyed the fact that it changed depends on from which angle you look at it. I decided to imbed the original sign without any chance because I thought they only made the image worse. Maybe I should have found the way to make the design less obvious and straightforward with its composition.</p>
