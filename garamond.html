      <p>For this project I was working with Garamond. I’ve chosen this font because first of all, I was interested in working with serifs, and second of all, Garamond has a huge history of being redrawn, recreated and redone by different people. I thought it would be interesting to be a part of such a historical process and have your own version of the font out of hundreds of others. I’ve also chosen this particular version of the font because it is really freely hand-drawn, which helped me to be not as necessarily precise and accurate sometimes. It gave me the freedom in some cases and really trained my eye.
