      <p>I was interested in what is happening inside gums looking at the mouth x-rays. After talks with medical specialists, I’ve figured out the exact sequence of tissues which are layered inside the mouth. The idea was to recreate the order in which tissues change one another by making a photogram for each layer. Photogram being presented as an alternative way of taking an x-ray of the mouth.
The texture and feel of gums the x-rays have, appealed to me the most, so in my tissue recreations I was firstly conveying that. Each photogram (6 in total) is made out of plastic and painted/collaged/mounted with various materials on top of it. Later the plastics were put on the photo paper and exposed to the light. I scanned the pieces and combined them all in one file, showing the order they go in.
The finished print looks abstract but might resemble the initial inspiration and that is what I like about it. It has the feel of it’s starting point, but is left for interpretation and attentive examination at the same time.
