      <p>This video is a reflection on a repetitive appearance of brand names in the book “Pattern recognition” by William Gibson.
I’ve decided to show these brands through two different perspectives: their stock market situation and people’s online reviews on their products.
The reviews appear in the chronological order as the brands in a book, and every time the brand name is mentioned by the reviewer, the next video starts playing on top of the previous one.
Each video is accompanied with the corporal/stock name of the brand, date of when the book was set in, the price of the stock at that time and whether it went up or down in the end of the day.
The information along with the video gives you an interesting look on the brands presented in the book, how they were percepted by the financial world at that time and genuine people’s thoughts on their products.
Every new video is scaled by the same percent and centred. The sound switches from the previous review, to the new, so you could only hear one video at a time, but see everything at once.
