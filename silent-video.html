      <p>In this project I decided to focus on the visual noice I encounter during my ride from home to the school. I thought this particular action would be great to look deeper into because it is something repetitive and could be studied day by day.
The outcome of the project was a silent video, sort of a flip through the book of information I collected during the ride. The medium of a book was something familiar and close to me, so I thought this form could help me feel more comfortable within the project restrictions. The initial idea for the video was to present the big chunk of visual intentional and unintentional design decisions noticed on the road. The book is made in a form of a journal, where the storyteller shares their findings during the ride.
The problem I faced was that I couldnâ€™t focus on anything in particular and was distracted by all the visual design possibilities of the researched subject. Maybe I could have focused on a particular feature of the ride (e.i. number plates) and keep it simple without any over complications of the subject matter.
